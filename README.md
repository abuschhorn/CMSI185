# Impact Calculator
This project focuses on environmental impacts based on different activities that pertain to water usage and CO2 emissions. Activities for water usage include cups of cow milk, soy milk, oat milk, loads on laundry, and toilet flushes. Activities for CO2 emissions include ounces of beef, miles traveled in a car, and tons of coal.
>*Did you know that 10 cups of soy milk is equivalent to 2.58 loads of laundry? Or that 8.0 ounces of beef is equivalent to 32.89 miles traveled in a car?*
